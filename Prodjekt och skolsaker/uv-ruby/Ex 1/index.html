            <h3>What is underwaterrugby?</h3>
            <p>What is underwater rugby? How do you play it? Why do they have so small swimming trunks? I will answer everything below. I’m Jonathan Tiliander and I play as a defender for Trelleborg's underwater team. <br> Underwater rugby (UWR) is a unique sport that is played in a 3 dimensional environment, it is played in 3 to 6 meter deep pools. The depth in the pool makes it 3 dimensional because you can be everywhere from the bottom to the top in the pool and on the sides. Unlike conventional rugby, in this sport the players play in water and they need to hold their breath to go down and maneuver underwater. The aim is to score goals by placing  the ball in the opposing team’s basket, which is at the bottom of the pool on the opposing team's side. The sport originated in Germany in the 1960s and it has now grown into an international sport with organized leagues and championships.</p>

            <h4>How do you play Uw-Rugby?</h4>
            <p>Underwater Rugby is a contact sport which is played in a deep swimming pool, usually a 3 to 6 meter deep pool. The length of the pool needs to be between 10 to 15 meters long. The height and length makes it 3 dimensional. The aim of the sport is to score in the other team's basket, which is located at the bottom of the pool.. You can only gain one point in UWRugby by putting the ball in the basket and you can’t earn extra points in underwater rugby unlike regular rugby. <br> What makes the sport even more unique is that the ball is not filled with air, instead it is filled with saltwater. “But why?” you may ask. Well air makes a ball float and we play underwater and need a ball that sinks so we filled the ball with saltwater and we play in chlorine water and saltwater has another density than chlorine water so it sinks. The ball moves slower than in many other sports due to the water’s resistance, requiring players to rely on strategy, teamwork, and spatial awareness.

            <h4>The basic rules</h4>
            <p>Underwater rugby is played with two teams, each consisting of 12 players. However, only 6 players per team (2 forwards, 2 goalkeeper and 2 defenders) are allowed in the water at any given time. The remaining players are substitutes who rotate in and out as needed. A typical game consists of two halves, each lasting between 8 to 15 minutes, with a short break in between usually 5 minutes. During that break the teams switch sides.</p>

                    <h4>Game start</h4>
                    <p>The game begins with the ball placed at the bottom of the pool's center. Players line up at their respective ends of the pool, and upon the referee's signal, they dive and swim as quickly as possible to gain possession of the ball.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4>objective</h4>
                    <p>The objective is to score goals by placing the ball in the opposing team's basket while defending your own basket from being scored upon. Players can pass the ball to teammates using any part of their body, but most passes are made by hand.</p>

                        <p> 1. Three-Dimensional Strategy:<br> Since the game occurs underwater, players can move in all directions—forward, backward, sideways, up, and down. This adds complexity and requires spatial awareness.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="sg-2">
                        <img src="../img/Pediatric-Breath-Holding2.png" alt="">
                        <p>2. Breath-Holding:<br> Players must hold their breath while diving to play the ball or defend. Effective breath control is crucial, as players constantly surface to breathe and then dive back into action.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="sg-3">

                        <p>3. Team Coordination:<br> Communication is challenging due to the underwater environment. Players rely on signals and quick hand movements to coordinate plays and strategies.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="sg-4">

                        <p>4. Physical Contact:<br> Similar to traditional rugby, UWR involves physical contact. Players can tackle opponents holding the ball to gain possession. However, rough play or unnecessary aggression is penalized.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="sg-5">

                        <p>5. Passing and Scoring:<br> Passing requires precision, as the water slows the ball's movement. Scoring occurs when a player successfully deposits the ball into the opposing team's basket.</p>

                    <h4>Substitutions</h4>
                    <p>Substitutions are made "on the fly" without stopping the game. Players exit and enter the water from their team’s designated side.</p>

                    <h4>Referees</h4>
                    <p>The game is officiated by three referees—one on the pool deck and two underwater. They ensure fair play and enforce rules, using underwater hand signals and buttons connected to a scoring system that uses a horn that sounds underwater. The referee that is on land ensure that the ball don’t leave the water and that they don’t drown each other.</p>
